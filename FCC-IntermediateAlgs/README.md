# Free Code Camp Intermediate Javascript Algorithms

As of January 25, 2018 I have completed 14 of the 21 intermediate algorithms, but again the solutions don't show again on the site anymore.  I did have the first seven copied into a section in my portfolio site project, but I lost the most recent 7 that I had done and I still have 7 more to do.
